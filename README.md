# Priority-Scheduling
Priority scheduling is a method of scheduling processes based on priority. In this method, the scheduler chooses the tasks to work as per the priority, which is different from other types of scheduling, for example, a simple round robin.

Priority scheduling involves priority assignment to every process, and processes with higher priorities are carried out first, whereas tasks with equal priorities are carried out on a first-come-first-served (FCFS) or round robin basis. An example of a general-priority-scheduling algorithm is the shortest-job-first (SJF) algorithm.
